# Genetic-Algorithm-Perfect-Population
In this study, the best chromosome is obtained in a new population as a result of randomly selecting and crossing two parents in a population of twenty individuals using genetic algorithm. Then, by continuing this crossover and mutation, the population consisting of the best chromosomes is obtained.

## Gen
The unit that carries the smallest information about our problem is called a gene. These individuals consist of 0 and 1.

## Chromosome
The sequences that form part of the information about the solution of the problem by combining one or more gene structures are called chromosomes.

## Population
Each gene assembly is called an individual, and individual aggregates are called populations.

## iteration
It is the continuation of the loop according to the determined number of iterations.

## Selection
Selection is the process of selecting parent individuals to create new individuals based on their fitness values in the population.

## Crossover
The crossover operator is applied after the selection process and expresses the mutual replacement of certain parts of the chromosomes of the parent individuals and thus the formation of individuals with new characteristics.

##Mutation
The mutation process is the process of changing a gene in any of the chromosomes of the newly formed individual depending on the probability of mutation.
